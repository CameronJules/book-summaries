# Overview
Engaging advertising starts here.

Creating 'Print direct response ads' are the best way to learn good marketing, due to limited pictures the text needs to sell the product. If you can create good print ads then your text can be used in other formats and be successful. This book outlines the techniques that can be used (chapters 1-18) and then provides case-studies for real world learning.

With all the summaries I make I recommend you read or at least skim the book yourself, as the takeaways I note in each chapter come from my starting point of information.

**How to use the summary:**
1) Skim the chapter titles
2) pick something interesting
3) read the summary
4) read deeper

# Chapter 1 - General knowledge
- Having a good breadth of knowledge about the world is essential to good copywriting, this will give you lots of information to draw upon when creating your ads.
- The best copy is written in print direct response ad, because the text MUST do all the work to sell the product.

# Chapter 2 - Specific Knowledge
- Your words need to flow easily into the readers mind, they shouldn't need to unscramble your message to understand it.
- The only goal of the first sentence is to make readers want to read the second sentence.
- Every sentence should make the reader want to read more.
- Know your product and your customer in depth. You must have expert understanding in both areas.
- Understand the products nature. This is the emotional response that customer connect with your product. For example, the an Iron might have associated feelings of crisp nice looking clothes. When a user thinks I want my clothes to look fresh and well kept they think of product X.

# Chapter 3 - Practice, Practice, Practice
-  To get good you need constant practice, it wont come easily.
- Copywriting is a mental process which requires your experiences, specific knowledge and ability to transfer information into clear text for success. 
- Your first draft will be bad, very bad. But thats good because you can EDIT as many times as you need to.
- The first draft should be an emotional outpouring on the topic. Anything and everything that will create the emotions needed should be dumped on to paper.
- Dump anything in your head on top paper. Don't wait for an idea to hit you

# Chapter 4/5 - Purpose of graphic elements & the first sentence
- The purpose of all elements outside of the main text (The headline, image, sub headline, caption). Is to get you to read the first sentence.
- Start with a very short sentence to hook attention. Its easy to read which make it easy for the reader to commit their time to it.
- Assume that the reader will only read the first sentence.

# Chapter 6/7 - Buying environment & Resonating with the reader
- Your first paragraphs should create a buying environment. Think about if you had to sell a $10,000 product. Where would you choose to meet the client? In mcDonalds or a fancy restaurant. actually BOTH are good options depending on what you are selling. If you are selling an ice cream machine a busy mcDonalds during the summer might be a great option. You need to create this correct environment mentally via text.
- The buyer must believe the seller knows the product well. And the seller needs to relate the product to the buyers needs. You are the seller.
- make use of harmony, getting buyers to say yes and be in agreement with you before hand will make them more likely to say yes later. Do this while creating trust.
# Chapter 8 - The slippery slide
- Use the slippery slide technique. Every element must be so compelling that you find yourself falling sown a slippery slide, unable to stop until you reach the end.
- if a reader reads 25% of your add they are very likely to reach the end (final sale).
- If you find yourself reading something and want to find out more, take a snip of it and save it for later as inspo.

# Chapter 9/10 - Assumed constraints & Seeds of Curiosity
- When coming up with marketing solutions don't assume there are things you cant do.
- When trying to solve problems, don't assume constraints that aren't really there. 
- Keep readers interested through the power of curiosity, this helps with the slippery slide.

# Chapter 11 - Copy as emotion
- You sell a product using emotion but justify a purchase using logic
- In some case if you create the right emotion and it is strong enough you wont even need logic as much
- First draft is an emotional outpouring of thoughts on the product . Get all of the feelings and emotions about the subject out on paper and then clean it up in editing later
- Be very careful with the word you choose because they can paint different pictures in peoples head. think about what thoughts come to mind at the word lawyer, police or farmer

# Chapter 12 - Selling the concept not the product
- Sell based on the abstract mental representation of the product and what it conveys. Think about selling the sizzle instead of the steak
- Price point can effect the perceived value and effectiveness of a product.

# Chapter 13/14 - The incubation process / How much copy should you write?
- Once you have thought about the title, sub headline, and image, wait a while. Let your subconscious process the information. It will synthesize the information and come up with solutions but dont focus on the task do something els and dont interrupt it
- Leaving time for incubation will allow you to bring all your knowledge and experience together
- Copy should covert the amount of time you need to create a selling environment, develop interest, relate the product to the prospects needs and make the sale.
- Lower price point may appear to lack credibility, if you educate the customer first you can subsequently demand more for the product.

# Chapter 15/16 - The art of personal communication / the copy sequence
- Writing should feel personal as if you are talking 1:1 with the person reading. From me to you.
- You should consider the readers thoughts so as a question comes up in their heads the copy soon answers it, as if reading their mind. This can be done by 'leading' the prospect rather than guessing their thoughts.
- Create a block diagram (like a flow diagram) of the logical way the copy flows into questions. Consider the points you want to cover, then the questions that might come up before continuing to the next point.
- Try 'patterning' your ad, pick a good ad written by someone else and replicate the style of writing.

# Chapter 17 - The editing process
- Express exactly what you want in the fewest words possible. Cut words out, substitute  words in, add words to clarify. 
- Repeat important information to make it stick but not in an obnoxious way.
- Watch out for 'that', usually words leading up to it can be eliminated
- Edit for rhythm, vary sentence length to not sound monotonous.
- Consider combining sentences
- Eliminate unnecessary words
- Rearrange thoughts so they flow better.
- Get feedback but dont feel pressured into changing things

# Chapter 18/19 - Powerful copy elements explained/ Psychological triggers
I wont regurgitate the explanations but will list the points that come up. id recommend referencing the book or searching the terms depending on what part of copy you are working on.

Chapter 18 has 23 elements and chapter 19 has 31 psychological triggers
