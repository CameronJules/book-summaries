# Overview

This book covers concepts of human behavior that would seem as irrational from the sense of traditional economics. This poses the challenge that classical economics is flawed because it assumes humans will act rationally given the right information and there for the markets will remain self correcting due to this nature. The book demonstrates this rationality is not the case.

# Chapter 1 - The truth about relativity

- The decisions that we make are largely based on relative comparisons we make from available information at the time. Even if the information we are using to compare is uncorrelated.
- Marketers often use this technique in the form of decoy pricing, setting a price along side an offer which is evidently inferior to the 'real' offers. This makes the real offers appear to be a better deal.
- We tend to compare things that are easily comparable even if they are less valuable comparisons, as opposed to a hard comparison that would have more valuable insight

# Chapter 2 - The fallacy of supply and demand

- We set arbitrary initial anchors which we use later for a base of comparison. If you ask someone the last digit of their social security number before asking them to price a good, if their number was higher they tend to price the good higher on average.
- Unchecked initial anchors can lead to worse compounding effect due to the idea of 'self-herding'. Here the mental model states, if we did something before it must be good enough for us so we should do it again.
- The sensitivity we have to price changes mostly comes from our memory of previous price rather than being a reflection of our current demand for a product.

# Chapter 3 / 4 - The cost of zero / social norms

- People value the 'Free' so much they will take a worse deal just to take advantage of the free offering
- There are social and market norms, in general these norms of behaviour can't mix. In social norms people are likely to do more for you if it is a favour compared being paid. If you then offer to pay switching to a market norm, where you offer something in return making the situation transactional, they will do less but will also not switch back to social norm afterwards.
- From the point above this means two things. 1) people do more if you ask for a favour than giving them a 'salary'. 2) When you introduce money to a social norm it become a market norm
- Companies often try to emulate social norms with their customers to build trust. This is a fine line to walk because once the social norm is broken, as it usually is with a transactional business, it becomes a market norm. This can't be returned to a social norm in most cases.

# Chapter 5 - The influence of arousal 

- When we are in a regular emotional state we are generally unable to predict our actions under a state of arousal or any emotional state.
- Be considerate of how your emotions affect your decisions.
- Companies aim to create an emotional effect around their products, in this state you are more likely to buy the product they are offering.

# Chapter 6 - The problem of procrastination and self control

- regardless of how much you think you procrastinate, you are underestimating yourself.
- We choose short term pleasure over long term gratification because we can't feel the immediate results of the action.
- External authority often breaks procrastination for 4 key reasons. 1) it forms social accountability and often is paired with real world consequences. 2) It reduces decision fatigue making it easier to start. 3) It appeals to our learned sense of hierarchy (possibly internalized obedience). 4) Imposes time constraints that overrides desire for current comfort.

# Chapter 7 - The high price of ownership

- Much of our life can be told by describing the ebb and flow of our possessions. In most cases if we feel ownership we fall in love with what we already have.
- People assume that we share the emotions and memories associated with an item and that can be translated into the price but this isn't the case.
- The more time you put into something the more your sense of ownership grows.
- We can begin to feel ownership before we own something through imagined senarios of what we can do once we do own something (virtual ownership).

# Chapter 8 - Keeping doors open

- People will keep their options open when given the chance even if it doesn't benefit them. Mostly driven by the desire to avoid loss.
- We don't notice the invisible doors (choices) that are closing slowly until its too late because we fail to realize that they need our attention. 
- We are more likely to avoid having doors close (lose choice) when we can feel it will immediately impact us.

# Chapter 9 - The effect of great expectations

- Whatever information you are primed with when entering a situation will drastically dictate how you actually think and feel about a situation, hence effecting the outcome.
- Even uncorrelated priming prior to a situation can effect the outcome. Funny example is that people who were asked questions about old people walked down the corridor slower when leaving compared to those that didn't get asked about old people.

# Chapter 10 - The power of price

- Higher price often creates a placebo of better quality
- When items are priced higher our expectations increase and even if it isn't what we expect we will still try to justify it.

# Chapter 11/12 - The context of our character part 1 / 2

- People will cheat when given the chance and often by the same amount regardless of the associated risk.
- When cash becomes involved the amount people are willing to cheat goes up significantly.
